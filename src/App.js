His mother was an ethnic Armenian who was a classical pianist, and his uncle was a piano and violin player as well. The first training was taken from these channels from a young age. The unique conditions between the years 1940 and 1950 are one of the important factors preventing Özdemir Erdogan from receiving formal arts education. Another issue is that his father prescribes an absolute basic education with the conditions of those dates. In this educational process, which lasted until the age of 15–16, Özdemir Erdoğan's artistic subjects were more likely to be found which were supported by his teachers at the schools.Özdemir Erdoğan graduated from Kadikoy Commercial High School in 1960 and completed his military service as a reserve officer teacher in Adıyaman, Besni Araplar village as a teacher." },
    { id: 1, name: "Barış Manço", img: barisM, history: "Mehmet Barış Manço (born Tosun Yusuf Mehmet Barış Manço;[1][2] 2 January 1943 – 1 February 1999), better known by his stage name Barış Manço, was a Turkish rock musician, singer, songwriter, composer, actor, television producer and show host.[3] Beginning his musical career while attending Galatasaray High School, he was a pioneer of rock music in Turkey and one of the founders of the Anatolian rock genre. Manço composed around 200 songs and is among the best-selling and most awarded Turkish artists to date. Many of his songs were translated into a variety of languages including English, French, Japanese, Greek, Italian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Persian, Hebrew, Urdu, Arabic, and German, among others.[4] Through his TV program, 7'den 77'ye ('From 7 to 77'), Manço traveled the world and visited many countries on the globe.[5] He remains one of the most popular public figures of Turkey." },
    { id: 2, name: "Cem Karaca", img: cemK, history: "He was the only child of Mehmet İbrahim Karaca, a theatre actor of Azerbaijani origin,[3] and İrma Felekyan (Toto Karaca), a popular opera, theatre and movie actress[3] of Armenian origin.[4] His first group was called Dynamites and was a classic rock cover band. Later he joined Jaguars, an Elvis Presley cover band. In 1967, he started to write his own music, joining the band Apaşlar (The Rowdies), his first Turkish language group. The same year, he participated in the Golden Microphone (Turkish: Altın Mikrofon) contest, a popular music contest in which he won second place with his song Emrah. In 1969, Karaca and bass-player Serhan Karabay left Apaşlar and started an original Anatolian group called Kardaşlar (The Brothers).In 1972, Karaca joined the group Moğollar (The Mongols) and wrote one of his best-known songs, 'Namus Belası'. However, Cahit Berkay, the leader of Moğollar, wanted an international reputation for his band, and he left for France to take the group to the next level. Karaca, who wanted to continue his Anatolian beat sound, left Moğollar and started his own band Dervişan (Dervishes) in 1974. Karaca and Dervişan sang poetic and progressive songs.In the 1970s, Turkey was dealing with political violence between supporters of the left and the right, separatist movements and the rise of Islamism. As the country fell into chaos, the government suspected Cem Karaca of involvement in rebel organisations. He was accused of treason for being a separatist thinker and a Marxist-Leninist. The Turkish government tried to portray Karaca as a man who was unknowingly writing songs to start a revolution. One politician was quoted as saying, 'Karaca is simply calling citizens to a bloody war against the state.' Dervişan was ultimately dissolved at the end of 1977. In 1978, he founded Edirdahan, an acronym for 'from Edirne to Ardahan'; the westernmost and the easternmost provinces of Turkey. He recorded one LP with Edirdahan.In early 1979, Karaca left for West Germany for business reasons. In 1980 he began singing in the German language with the song Nazim Hikmet - Kız Çocuğu (in English: Little girl): Cem performed the German verses alternating with his friend, manager, arranger and bandleader/musician Ralf Mähnhöfer accompanying him on grand piano, solo or with the band Anatology, singing the song in the Turkish language.Turkey continued to spin out of control with military curfews and the 1980 Turkish coup d'état on September 12, 1980. General Kenan Evren took over the government and temporarily banned all the nation's political parties. After the coup, many intellectuals, including writers, artists and journalists, were arrested. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Karaca by the government of Turkey.The state invited Karaca back several times, but Karaca, not knowing what would happen upon his return, decided not to come back.While Karaca was in Germany his father died, but he could not return to attend the funeral. After some time, the Turkish government decided to strip Cem Karaca of his Turkish citizenship, keeping the arrest warrant active.Several years later, in 1987, the prime minister and leader of the Turkish Motherland Party, Turgut Özal, issued an amnesty for Karaca. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Turkey. His return also brought a new album with it, Merhaba Gençler ve Her Zaman Genç Kalanlar ('Hello, The Young and The Young at Heart'), one of his most influential works. His return home was received cheerfully by his fans, but during his absence Karaca had lost the young audience and acquired only a few new listeners. He died of a heart attack on February 8, 2004 and was interred at Karacaahmet Cemetery in the Üsküdar district of Istanbul." },
    { id: 3, name: "Erkin Koray", img: erkinK, history: "Erkin Koray (Turkish pronunciation: [æɾˈcin ˈkoɾaj]; born 24 June 1941) is a Turkish singer-songwriter, guitarist and one of the pioneers of Anatolian rock.[1]Koray has been in the Turkish rock music scene since the late 1950s. He is widely acclaimed as being the first person to ever play rock and roll in Turkey; in 1957, he and his band gained fame by playing covers of Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. He was also one of the first Turkish musicians to embrace the electric guitar and modern amplification. In addition to his own compositions, he rearranged multiple well known Turkish folk songs. By combining Western and Eastern musical styles, Koray pioneered in the development of Turkish rock music genre and Anatolian rock sound.By the late 1960s, he had become a major figure in Turkish psychedelic music and Anatolian rock, beginning with his first psychedelic single Anma Arkadaş in 1967. Koray followed this with a number of singles, both by himself and in collaboration with others, that established him as a force to be reckoned with on the Turkish rock scene.In the early 1970s, he formed the group Ter with the former members of the band Bunalım ('Group Depression'). Although they only recorded one single before breaking up, Hor Görme Garibi (a cover of the major Arabesque music hit by Orhan Gencebay) was a smash hit, furthering Koray's career. Ter was influenced by fuzz rock and psychedelia and featured extended guitar solos and progressive arrangements – something that the record company was not prepared to accept. In 1973, his first album, Erkin Koray, was released, consisting of a collection of singles from 1967 to 1973. He left Istanbul Records after the release of the album. In 1974, he signed with Doglan Records and released Şaşkın (Dabke).[citation needed]1974 also saw the release of his groundbreaking album, Elektronik Türküler ('Electronic Ballads'). Finally given the freedom to record an album instead of being limited to 45 rpm singles, Koray and his band created an album that reflected both his Turkish roots and his love of psychedelic and progressive rock. The album's popularity continues to the present day, with several legitimate and non-legitimate releases on both album and CD. Now Koray lives in Vancouver Canada and continues to create new songs to this day, and in Turkish music circles he is often referred to as Erkin Baba ('Erkin the Father') for his pioneering influence on Turkish popular music.Other major hits by Koray are Fesuphanallah, Istemem, Sevince, Öyle Bir Geçer Zaman ki , Estarabim, Arap Saçı, Yalnızlar Rıhtımı, Akrebin Gözleri and Çöpçüler. In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), a flowering of interest in psychedelic music made outside of the UK and the US brought Koray to the attention of listeners in the West. Koray is also the inventor of the electric bağlama,[1] a traditional Turkish musical instrument related to the lute, and its unique sound can be heard on many of his albums." },

Her father was a veterinarian medician of Macedonian Turk origin from the town of Bitola and her mother was a teacher of Crimean Tatar origin.[3] She had two older brothers named Savaş and Sezer, and a younger brother named Serter was born when Selda was two years old.[4] The family relocated to Van shortly after Serter was born, where Selda spent most of her childhood. Her father, Selim, was a music enthusiast who played the saxophone and the flute, and he encouraged all his children to start playing instruments from a very young age. Selda herself started to play the mandolin when she was five.[4] The family spent many evenings playing music together, under the direction of Selim.Upon Selim's unexpected death from typhoid fever in 1957, the rest of the family moved to Ankara to be close to the mother's sister.[5] Selda continued to play the mandolin, and picked up the guitar as well, during her middle school and high school years.[6] At first she sang English, Italian and Spanish songs she picked up on the radio, but during her years as a student at Ankara University's engineering physics department, she started to develop an interest in traditional Turkish folk music, inspired by early Anatolian rock singers like Cem Karaca, Barış Manço and Fikret Kızılok, as well as the folk singer Saniye Can.[7] Her brothers owned a popular music club named Beethoven in central Ankara, where she met some of these singers in person and where she was a regular performer herself throughout her years as a university student.[5]" },
    { id: 6, name: "3 Hürel", img: hurel3, history: "Hürel brothers were born in Trabzon and later moved to İstanbul due to family business. In 1966, the brothers formed their first band, Yankılar, which was later renamed to İstanbul Dörtlüsü. The band performed in small music halls and tried to synthesize Turkish music and traditional rock formats.

          <h1 className="titles">What is Anatolian Rock</h1>
          <p>In the late 1950s, Turkish singers such as Erol Büyükburç began to release English-language cover versions of American songs, as well as their own songs. By the early 1960s, Turkish groups began to perform instrumentals such as those by The Shadows and The Ventures. Although often locally popular performers, these Turkish groups were rarely recorded. The first original Turkish-language pop song was "Ayrılanlar İçin", released in 1964 by Timur Selçuk. Other singers also emerged, including Barış Manço, who first recorded in the early 1960s before later spearheading the growth of Turkish rock music in the 1970s with albums such as 2023 (1975).At the same time, Turkish society began to undergo significant cultural changes, including the growth of multi-party democracy in the region.Turkish musicians also regularly performed at competitive European music festivals. In 1964, Tülay German performed the song "Burçak Tarlası" at the Balkan Music Festival, in a bossa nova style, and became immediately popular. As a direct result, the newspaper Hürriyet organised a "Golden Microphone" (Altın Mikrofon) competition, to encourage the development of popular Turkish music either by new compositions or by using domestic sources. This helped identify a new generation of musicians, including the groups Mavi Işıklar and Silüetler, and musicians Cem Karaca, Selçuk Alagőz and his sister Rana Alagőz.The domestic rock music scene in Turkey expanded rapidly in the mid- and late 1960s. From 1968 to about 1975, psychedelic rock became popular in Turkey, notably the work of guitarist Erkin Koray,[3] regarded as a "hugely influential figure on the Istanbul music scene".The band Moğollar are credited with "changing the landscape of Turkish rock by incorporating elements of Anatolian folk music," and, after recording in France as Les Mogols, named their musical genre Anadolu Pop. Another pioneer, Fikret Kızılok, combined the style of Anadolu Pop with overtly political lyrics, and experiments with electronic music.</p>
